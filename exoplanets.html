        <h2>The Proxima Centauri System</h2>
        <p>Proxima Centauri, the closest known star to the Sun, hosts exoplanets that offer a glimpse into the possibilities of life beyond Earth. Located just 4.24 light-years away, this red dwarf star is part of the Alpha Centauri system.It is a small, low-mass star, too faint to be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 11.13.</p>

    <h3>ðŸš€ Detection Methods ðŸš€</h3>
    <p>These exoplanets were discovered using advanced detection techniques:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Radial Velocity Method:</strong> Measures the star's wobble due to gravitational pull from orbiting planets.</li>
        <li><strong>Transit Method:</strong> Detects slight dimming of the starâ€™s light as planets pass in front of it.</li>
    </ul>
